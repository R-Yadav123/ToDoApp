# ToDoApp
Created in Kode With Klossy, IOS To Do App



This IOS App uses features which was created in Xcode. 
A switch, labels, text fields, table view controller, view controllers, buttons, and other tools in Xcode all contributed to the app. This To Do App also displays an app icon. After the user exits out of the app, the tasks are saved. This was mostly the task of implementing core data in the Swift project.

Actions/outlets and storyboards were also utilized.

Furthermore, the plus icon indicates a new task while the switch (on/off functionality) lets the user decide if the task is important or not. If the task is considered important, emojis of importance surround the task; however, if the user turns off the switch the emojis do not surround the specific task.

This IOS App was completely coded in Swift.

Below the video showcases a demo of how the app functions:
